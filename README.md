# ApostropheCMS essentials starter kit

## Tailwind CSS configuration steps

Following the official guide: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite

1. Install Tailwind CSS
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

2. Init
```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

3. Edit the created `tailwind.config.js` to become:
```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './apos-build/@apostrophecms/vite/default/src/**/*.{js,jsx}',
    './modules/**/views/**/*.html',
    './views/**/*.html',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

4. Create `./modules/asset/ui/src/tailwind.css` with the following content:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

5. Edit `./modules/asset/ui/src/index.js` to import the CSS file:
```js
import './tailwind.css'
// The rest is the same
```

6. Edit `./modules/@apostrophecms/home-page/views/page.html` and add (server side rendering testing):
```html
    <div class="text-center">
      <span class="box-decoration-clone bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-600 to-pink-500 text-white px-2 leading-3">
        Hello World <br />
        From Tailwind CSS
      </span>
    </div>
```

7. Edit `./modules/todoapp/ui/src/app/App.jsx` and add (UI testing):

```jsx
      <div class="text-center">
        <span
          class="box-decoration-clone bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-600 to-pink-500 text-white px-2"
        >
          Hello World <br />
          From Tailwind CSS
        </span>
      </div>
```

8. `npm run dev`

## Getting started

This Starter Kit, also known as a boilerplate project, serves as a template for initiating new projects and is intended for use in two main ways:

1. **Using Our CLI Tool**: Run our [CLI tool](https://github.com/apostrophecms/cli) to clone this template locally, install its dependencies, and set up an initial admin user. You accomplish this using:
   
   `apos create <my-project-name>`
  
2. **Manual Setup**: Manually `git clone` this repository and install its dependencies using `npm install`. Add an initial admin user with `node app @apostrophecms/user:add admin admin`.

For those who need to create multiple projects with additional base modules, consider [forking this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) into your organizational or personal GitHub account. Customize it to fit your needs. To use your customized template, run the following CLI command:

  `apos create <project-name> --starter=<repo-name>`

Here, `<repo-name>` should be the URL of your forked repository, excluding the `https://github.com/` part.

**Note: This template is NOT designed to be installed into an existing project.**

## Running the project

Run `npm run dev` to build the Apostrophe UI and start the site up. Remember, this is during alpha development, so we're all in "dev mode." The `dev` script will watch for saves in client-side CSS and Javascript and trigger a build and page refresh if they are detected. It will also restart the app when server-side code is saved.

## Making it your own

This boilerplate is designed so you can install and start running it right away. If you are starting a project that will go into production one day, there are a few things you should be sure to check:

- [ ] **Update the shortname.** You don't need to perform this step if you created your project using the CLI tool. The `shortname` option in `app.js` is used for the database name (unless another is given in the `@apostrophecms/db` module). You should change this to an appropriate project name before you start adding any users or content you would like to keep.
- [ ] **Update the Express.js session secret.** The secret is set to `undefined` initially in the `modules/@apostrophecms/express/index.js` file. You should update this to a unique string.
- [ ] **Decide if you want hot reloading on.** This boilerplate uses nodemon to restart the app when files are changed. In `modules/@apostrophecms/asset/index.js` there is an option enabled to refresh the browser on restart. If you like this, do nothing. If you don't, remove the option or set it to `false`. The option has no effect when the app is in production.
- [ ] **Update the `className` options in `app.js`.** This option is set for core widget types to provide CSS styling hooks. It is namespaced with `bp-` for "boilerplate." You will likely want to update that to match your general CSS class naming practices.

## You really want the docs

Right now, [all the juicy info is in the ApostropheCMS docs](https://docs.apostrophecms.org), so head over there and start reading! This boilerplate project is a fun introduction to the UI, but you'll want to know more to really try it out.
